# A Short Exercise to Explore Object-Oriented Programming - C# - Encapsulation

---
## Overview

This repository is a short exercise designed for you to explore **Encapsulation** which is one of the
four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## üìñ Instructions

- Fork this repository

- To run the program, go to [Program.cs](/Encapsulation/Encapsulation/Program.cs) which is the entry point and run it using Visual Studio.

- üí° You will notice that as of .NET 6+, the code you would need to write for a new program has been simplified. You can learn more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/top-level-templates).

- There are two models `DodgyBankAccount` and `SecureBankAccount`, these are located in the [Models](/Encapsulation/Encapsulation/Models/) directory.

## ü§ì Study Prompts

Use the following questions to guide your exploration and learning! üó∫

- Run your Console application, what is it doing? What is being outputted to the console?
My answer: The console produces some text showing that the DodgyBankAccount section of code is allowing the main class to access its variables directly and make changes, while the SecureBankAccount section isn't. 

- Look at the `DodgyBankAccount`, this class is not well-encapsulated. Can you note down the problems with how the class is designed, and the ways it is being misused?
My answer:
1) All variables are allowing public access. Any other classes in the project can have access or make changes to these vaiables.
2) No specific naming conventions to identify the type of variable whether they are class-specific or from other classes.

- Compare and contrast the `DodgyBankAccount` and the `SecureBankAccount`, how is the `SecureBankAccount` different to the `DodgyBankAccount`? How is it designed to prevent it from being misused? Are there instances of better method names for clearer abstraction?
My answer:
1) All variables are made private.
2) A constant is used in place of a variable to identify that the value is not supposed to be changed.
3) A variable is set to read only for any other classes, and can make changes only from within this class.
4) A variable is set to only for use within the class, and will be destroyed once the class ends.
5) All variable names within this class are identified by starting with an underline.

## üê∏ Extension Challenge

- Now that you've had the chance to explore a well-encapsulated vs. poorly-encapsulated class,
your next challenge is to put your newly minted skills into practice üí™!

- Refactor the `WeatherReporter` class located in the [Models](/Encapsulation/Encapsulation/Models/) directory.

- You may want to think about Encapsulation here. Do the methods follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)? Are the method names suitable? Are there any magic numbers / hardcoded numbers in the code that needs to be represented by a constant? Are there better ways to write the code?

- As an added challenge, could you write some unit tests to test the class' methods?
